My favorite sequence by far was the film's climactic recreation of Queen's iconic performance during 1985's Live Aid. This was perhaps the highlight of the band's career, showcasing Freddie Mercury at his most potent and powerful. So, the news that the upcoming home video release will include a full recreation of it is good to hear as far as I'm concerned.  ",
